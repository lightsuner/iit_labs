        Ritchie left school at age 15 and worked entry-level jobs in the film industry before going on to direct television commercials. In 1995, he directed a short film, The Hard Case, followed by the crime-comedy, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), his directorial debut in a feature film. He soon gained recognition with his second film, Snatch (2000), which also found critical and commercial success. He went on to direct Revolver (2005) and RocknRolla (2008), which were less successful and received mixed audience reviews. In 2009 and 2011, he directed two box-office hits, Sherlock Holmes and its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, respectively. The former was nominated for two Academy Awardsâ€”Best Original Score and Best Art Direction.
